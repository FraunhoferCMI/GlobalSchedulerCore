# isone-history
Here is where we manage the historical data available from ISONE in order to 
feed it into our own databases. Currently there's a MonetDB database up and running. 

And also calls to fetch live data.

The LMP node we are most likely on is 4332, Ayer, or
"LD.AYER 69" for the nearby town of Ayer, MA.

Example Web services calls for it:

/fiveminutelmp/current/location/4332
fiveminutelmp/day/20161003/location/4332
